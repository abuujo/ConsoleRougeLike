This is just a small Rougelike I made as a side project.

Programmed in C++ using cout to display the game and any text.

**To Do:**

 * [easy] Clean up code, add in #defines etc.
 * [hard] Build a procgen world map similar to Dwarf Fortress
 * [medium] Add spells / other damage types
 * [easy] Add health pots (should be easy..)
 * [probably easy] Add inventory
 
 *This was made as part of my goal to learn C++*
